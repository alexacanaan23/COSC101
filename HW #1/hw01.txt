# Write your responses to the questions in part 1 below:

I have no questions on the syllabus.
I have no questions about academic integrity in this course. Everything that I turn in should be my own work. Meeting and discussing things is fine, but I can’t take anyone’s code or part of their code and use it as my own. I must be explicit about who I work with.

# Write your answer to the question in part 2 below:

How to wash a dish

Assumptions:
-someone knows how to use certain objects (sponges, sinks, eating materials)

1. Be in the kitchen at a/the sink with a drying rack or other drying mechanism next to the sink.
2. Assuming the dirty dish is in the sink, turn the sink on with the water at a warm temperature anywhere between the middle and hottest setting, depending on your own preference and comfort.
3. Grab dish soap and put 2 pea sized amounts of soap on a sponge.
4. Grab the dish with your less dominant hand and the sponge with the soap in your dominant hand.
5. Rub the soapy side of the sponge onto the dish in a circular motion. Make sure to cover the whole dish. Keep rubbing until you don’t see any more stains of food or grease.
6. Repeat on the other side.
7. Put the sponge down. Rinse the dish by putting it under the running water until soap bubbles stop coming off of the dish.
8. Put the dish on the drying rack and turn off the sink. 
9. Continue to drying procedure or repeat the washing procedure with other dishes.
