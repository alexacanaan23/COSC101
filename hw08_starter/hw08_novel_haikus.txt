flatland by edwin / a abbott to the of space / in general and
of flatland in the / hope that even as he was / initiated
and the possible / development of that most / and excellent gift
we call it so but / to make its nature clearer / to you my happy
squares pentagons and / other figures instead of / remaining fixed in
about on or in / the surface but without the / power of rising
above or sinking / below it very much like / hard with luminous
alas a few years / ago i should have said but / now my mind has been
of what you call a / kind but i dare say you will / suppose that we could
at least distinguish / by sight the triangles squares / and other figures
moving about as / i have described them on the / contrary we could
was visible nor / could be visible to us / except straight lines and
the necessity / of this i will speedily / demonstrate place a
in space and leaning / over it look down upon / it it will appear
yourself more and more / into the condition of / the inhabitants
of and you will find / the penny becoming more / and more oval to
on the edge of the / table that you are as it / were actually
at all and will have / become so far as you can / see a straight line the
other figure cut / out from as soon as you look / at it with your eye
on the edge of the / table you will find that it / ceases to appear
and that it becomes / in appearance a straight line / take for example
and represent the / as you would see him if your / eye were close to the
and if your eye were / quite on the level of the / table that is how
we see him in you / would see nothing but a straight / line when i was in
experiences / while they traverse your seas and / discern some distant
number and extent / yet at a distance you see / none of these indeed
them revealing the / projections and retirements / by means of light and
nothing but a grey / unbroken line upon the / water well that is
light of such a kind / as to make shadows we have / none of the helps to
to us we see his / line becomes larger if he / leaves us it becomes
smaller but still he / looks like a straight line be he / a triangle square
circle what you straight / line he looks and nothing else / you may perhaps ask
we are able to / distinguish our friends from / one another but
of flatland for the / present let me defer this / subject and say a
of the climate and / houses in flatland as with / you so also with
us there are four points / of the compass north south east / and west there being
no sun nor other / heavenly bodies it is / impossible for
us to determine / the north in the usual / way but we have a
method of our / own by a law of nature / with us there is a
constant attraction / to the south and although in / temperate climates this
is quite sufficient / to serve as a compass in / most parts of our
earth moreover the / rain falls at stated coming / always from the north
assistance and in / the towns we have the guidance / of the houses which
for the most part north / and south so that the roofs may / keep off the rain from
in which the southward / attraction is hardly felt / walking sometimes in
compelled to remain / stationary for hours / together waiting
continuing my / journey on the weak and aged / and especially on
delicate females / the force of attraction tells / much more heavily
thing to do always / at short notice when you are / in rude health and in
at all times and in / all places whence we know not / it was in old days
with our learned men / an interesting and question / is the origin
attempted with no / other result than to crowd / our lunatic
indirectly by / making them liable to / a heavy tax the
legislature in / comparatively recent / times absolutely
of the truths of space / and of the theory of the / introduction of
light from the world of / three if i were the of the / mad but a truce to
of a house is or / as in the annexed figure / the two northern sides
ro of constitute / the roof and for the most part / have no doors on the
east is a small door / for the women on the west / a much larger one
house residence might / do serious injury / to an or perhaps
of our era / triangular houses were / universally
that the general / public should approach without / circumspection at
by a special tax / but about three centuries / afterwards the law

the inhabitants / of flatland the greatest length / or breadth of a full

a hexagon and / so on but this rule applies / not always to the
and still less often / to the soldiers and to the / workmen who indeed

of a circle in / the happy region of the / three shall i make it
recall what i told / you above all beings in / flatland animate
is threefold the first / means of recognition is / the sense of hearing
us not only to / distinguish by the voice of / our personal
orders the the square / and the the isosceles / i take no account
in difficulty / partly because voices are / assimilated
and wherever there / is any danger of we / cannot trust to this
to a degree more / than correspondent with those / of hearing so that
an isosceles / can easily feign the voice / of a polygon
and with some training / that of a circle himself / a second method
is among our / women and lower our / upper classes i
shall speak principal / test of recognition at / all events between
strangers and when the / question is not as to the / individual
but as to the class / what therefore is among the / higher classes in
that the process of / is with us me to ask you / to feel and be felt
country gentlemen / in districts remote from towns / the customary
to me ask you to / feel mr although it is / assumed of course that
by the use of in / a technical sense meaning / and at this moment
as smith permit me / to feel mr let not my / reader however
suppose that is with / us the tedious process / that it would be with
you or that we find / it necessary to feel / right round all the sides
at once by the sense / of touch between the angles / of an triangle
square and pentagon / and i need not say that the / brainless vertex of
touch it is therefore / not necessary as a / rule to do more than
those of my readers / who recall the extracts i / gave above from the
of introduction / by contact requires some / care and discretion
injury it is / essential for the safety / of the feeler that
with them the eye is / situated so far from / their vertex that they
not sensitive to / the delicate touch of the / highly organized
toss of the head has / ere now deprived the state of / a valuable life
and social board for / passing him into the class / of the deplored with
working man with an / angle or brain of degrees / minutes according
being afflicted / with rheumatism and in / the act of being
by one sudden start / accidentally transfixed / the great man through the
and a half in their / ascent towards better things / the result was that
the family brain / was registered at only / degrees and not till
in the process of / feeling as this point i think / i hear some of my
about angles and / degrees or minutes we see / an angle because
but you who can see / nothing but on straight line at / a time or at all
events only a / number of bits of straight lines / all in one straight can
i answer that though / we cannot see angles we / can infer them and
nor must i omit / to explain that we have great / natural helps it
is with us a law / of nature that the brain of / the isosceles
of which are placed in / every elementary / school throughout the land
stagnation and to / the extraordinary / fecundity of
the criminal and / vagabond classes there is / always a vast of
by the states to the / service of education / fettered so as to
fed and suffered to / exist for several years but / in the more temperate
of the existence / of the criminal class in / the cheaper schools what
of the angles which / are impaired after a few / weeks of constant nor
of the redundant / isosceles object which / every statesman
elected school boards / there is a reaction in / of cheap as it is
am myself disposed / to think that this is one of / the many cases
has been said i trust / to shew that recognition / by feeling is not
more trustworthy than / recognition by hearing / still there remains as
has been pointed out / above the objection that / this method is not
without danger for / this reason many in the / middle and lower
to explain to my / critics how we are able / to recognize one
another by the / sense of sight if however / the reader will take
is stated to be / universal he will find / this the lower it
is only among / the higher classes and in / our more temperate
is the result of / fog which prevails during the / greater part of the
evil blotting out / the landscape depressing the / spirits and the health
inferior to / air itself and as the nurse / of arts and parent
approaching whose rank / i wish to ascertain they / are we will suppose
a merchant and a / physician or in other / words an triangle
studies that if i / can bring my eye so that its / glance may an angle
of the approaching / stranger my view will lie as / it were evenly
and both will appear / of the same size now in the / case of the merchant
what shall i see i / shall see a straight line dae in / which the middle point
will be very bright / because it is nearest to / me but on either
hand in the case of / the physician though i shall / here also see a
less rapidly to / because the sides recede less / rapidly into

patrons have grasped this / general conception so / far as to conceive
who may perchance the / two simple instances i / have given above

of you nothing but / a line apparently straight / but of which the parts
and were perfect in / the theory of the subject / you would still find there
you could move in a / fashionable crowd without / jostling against
your betters whom it / is against etiquette to / ask to and who by
their superior / culture and breeding know all / about your movements
while you know very / little or nothing about / theirs in a word to

are closed against them / and though in most states they are / not actually
nobility that / the great and of past ages / have generally
derived their leaders / and so great is the mischief / thence arising that
into the subject / of irregularities / a matter of such
pages i have been / perhaps should have been laid down / at the beginning
as a distinct and / fundamental every / human being in
by this i mean that / a woman must not only / be a line but a
or soldier must have / two of his sides equal that / tradesmen must have three
sides equal lawyers / which class i am a humble / four sides equal and
generally that / in every polygon / all the sides must be
upon the age of / the individual a / female at birth would

i am speaking of / the equality of sides / and it does not need
life in flatland rests / upon the fundamental / fact that nature wills
all figures to have / their sides equal if our / sides were unequal
of feeling but life / would be too short for such a / tedious groping
the whole science and / art of sight recognition / would at once perish

section how i had / a vision of it was the / last day but one of
the year of our / era and the first day of / the long vacation
till a late hour / with my recreation of / geometry i
had retired to rest / with an unsolved problem in / my mind in the night
of small straight lines i / naturally assumed to / be interspersed with
other beings still / smaller and of the nature / of lustrous moving
to and fro in one / and the same straight line and as / nearly as i could
a noise of confused / chirping or issued from them / at intervals as
but sometimes they ceased / from motion and then all was / silence approaching
rudeness i brought my / mouth to a position full / in front of her mouth
motion to and fro / in one and the same straight am / no replied the small
line am the monarch / of the world but thou whence thou / into my realm of
his royal highness / and describing myself as / a stranger i the
to him must also / be known to me and that i / was simulating
he called persuaded / that the straight line which he called / his kingdom and in
constituted the / whole of the world and indeed / the whole of space not
to move or to see / save in his straight line he had / no conception of
anything out of / it though he had heard my voice / when i first addressed
him the sounds had come / to him in a manner so / contrary to his
experience that / he had made no answer no / as he expressed it
hearing a voice as / it were from my own until / the moment when i
placed my mouth in his / world he had neither seen me / nor heard anything
except confused sounds / beating against what i called / his side but what he
of the region from / which i had come outside his / world or line all was
a blank to him nay / not even a blank for a / blank implies space say
rather all was his / whom the small lines were men and / the points all alike
confined in motion / and eyesight to that single / straight line which was their
world it need scarcely / be added that the whole of / their horizon was
see anything but / a point man woman child as / a point to the eye
and no one could move / to the right or left to make / way for passers by
it followed that no / could ever pass another / once always with them
was like marriage with / us remained till death did them / part such a life with
to a point and all / motion to a straight line seemed / to me dreary and
but at last i plunged / into it by abruptly / inquiring as
well and staggered at / this in the immediate / proximity of
the monarch i had / noted in my dream before / i entered there were
none but ventured to / reply me but i cannot / imagine how your
royal highness can / at any time either see / or approach their when
whom you can neither / see through nor pass by is it / possible that in
it were indeed as / you suggest the universe / would soon be no no
is needless for the / union of hearts and the birth / of children is too
are consummated / by means of the faculty / of sound and the sense
of hearing are of / course aware that every / man has two mouths or
i replied that i / had but one voice and that i / had not been aware
herself ordained that / every man should wed two / asked i carry your
union without the / combination of the four / in one the bass and
tenor of the man / and the soprano and of / the two said i a
man should prefer one / wife or is he said is as / inconceivable
as follows in the / middle of each week a law / of nature compels
for the time you would / take to count a hundred and / one in the midst of
this choral dance at / the the inhabitants of / the universe pause
boy would you ignore / the very alphabet of / he ceased speechless for
marriage chorus on / the contrary the process / is by most of us
few are the hearts whose / happy lot is at once to / recognize in each
may perhaps accord / with one of the future wives / but not with both or
the result is at / last achieved there comes a day / at last when while the
how i vainly tried / to explain the nature of / flatland thinking that
of the truth that is / to say of the nature of / things in flatland so
of his subjects i / for my part noticed by the / sense of sight before
a line and a point / by the sense of sight is as / every one knows
in the nature of / things impossible but it / can be detected
and by the same means / my shape can be exactly / ascertained behold
me again and i / have i apologized but / he continued you
are impervious / to argument you shall hear / with your ears how by
i reveal my shape / to my wives who are at this / moment six thousand
miles seventy yards / two feet eight inches away / the one to the north
continued wives at / this moment receiving the / sound of one of my
inches infer that / one of my mouths is inches / further from them than
know my shape to be / inches but you will of course / understand that my
wives do not make this / calculation every / time they hear my two
voices they made it / once for all before we were / married but they could
make it at any / time and in the same way i / can estimate the
shape of any of / my male subjects by the sense / of said i a man
a woman's voice with / one of his two voices or / so disguises his
southern voice that it / cannot be recognized as / the echo of the
and have you no means / of checking frauds of this kind / by commanding your
subjects to feel one / this of course was a very / stupid question for
feeling could not have / answered the purpose but i / asked with the view of
irritating the / monarch and i succeeded / perfectly cried he
in horror your touch / come into i replied you / mean by said the king
and more exactly / by the sense of hearing as / to your suggested
it is for the voice / being the essence of one's / being cannot be
thus changed at will but / come suppose that i had the / power of passing
through solid things so / that i could penetrate my / subjects one after
verifying the / size and distance of each by / the sense of feeling
i take as it were / the census and statistics / local mental and
spiritual of / every living being / in hark only so
to a sound which seemed / to me no better than a / tiny chirping from
grasshoppers replied / i sense of hearing serves you / in good stead and fills
up many of your / deficiencies but permit / me to point out that
your life in must be / dull to see nothing but a / point not even to
a straight line nay not / even to know what a straight / line is to see yet
for the concert of / all which gives you such intense / pleasure is to me
no better than a / or chirping but at least i / can discern by sight
i came into your / kingdom i saw you dancing / from left to right and
proximity on / the left and eight men and two / women on your right
that you saw these things / for how could you see the line / that is to say the
inside of any / man but you must have heard these / things and then dreamed that
you saw them and let / me ask what you mean by those / words and i suppose
it is your way of / saying northward and replied / i your motion of
northward and southward / there is another motion / which i call from right
you could step out of / your line altogether king / out of my line do
you mean out of the / world out of space i well yes / out of your world out
of your space for your / space is not the true space true / space is a plane but
it to me in words / i if you cannot tell your / right side from your left
i fear that no words / of mine can make my meaning / clearer to you but
you i alas how / shall i make it clear when you / move straight on does it
your eye round so as / to look in the direction / towards which your side
do you never feel / a desire to move in / the direction so
to speak of your side / king never and what do you / mean how can a man's
which i desire / to indicate to you at / the word i began
to move my body / out of as long as any / part of me remained
in his dominion / and in his view the king kept / exclaiming see you
i see you still you / are not but when i had at / last moved myself out
of his line he cried / in his voice is vanished she / is am not replied
i am simply out / of that is to say out of / the straight line which you
call space and in the / true space where i can see things / as they are and at
this moment i can / see your line or inside as / you are pleased to call
it and i can see / also the men and women / on the north and south
their order their size / and the interval between / when i had done this
at great length i cried / triumphantly that at last / convince and with that
to have only one / voice i have little doubt you / are not a man but
a if you had a / particle of sense you would / listen to reason
line besides that which / my senses indicate and / another motion
besides that of which / i am daily conscious i / in return ask you
to describe in words / or indicate by motion / that other line of
some magic art of / vanishing and returning / to sight and instead
of any lucid / description of your new world / you simply tell me
of some forty of / my retinue facts known to / any child in my
that he professed to / be ignorant of my sex / i retorted in
the most imperfect / and imbecile you profess / to see whereas you
the existence of / a straight line but i can see / straight lines and infer
of your incomplete / self you are a line but i / am a line of lines
there arose from of / his subjects a increasing / in vehemence till
at last methought it / the roar of an army of / a hundred thousand
isosceles and / the artillery of a / thousand pentagons
destruction and still / the noise grew louder and the / king came closer when
i awoke to find / the recalling me to the / realities of
a stranger from from / dreams i proceed to facts it / was the last day of
era the of the / rain had long ago announced / nightfall and i was
of my wife musing / on the events of the past / and the prospects of
had retired to their / several apartments and my / wife alone remained
with me to see the / old millennium out and / the new one in i
young hexagon of / unusual and perfect / his uncles and i
turning ourselves / upon our centres now / rapidly now more
to reward him by / giving him a few hints on / arithmetic as
so as to make one / large square with a side of three / inches and i had
squaring the number / of inches in the side said / i know that or nine
on this a while and / then said to me you have been / teaching me to raise
for geometry / has only two and then i / began to shew the
boy how a point by / moving through a length of three / inches makes a line
of three inches which / may be represented by / three and how a line
through a length of three / inches makes a square of three / inches every
in disgrace and there / i sat by my wife's side to / form a retrospect
of the year and of / the possibilities of / the year but not quite
able to shake of / the thoughts suggested by the / prattle of my bright
aloud boy is a / i became conscious of a / presence in the room
and a chilling breath / thrilled through my very being / is no such cried my
wife you are breaking / the commandments in thus your / own but i took no
as the cold whisper / came again i started up / is the said my wife
is no draught what are / you looking for there is there / was nothing and i
exclaiming boy is / a fool i say can have no / meaning in at once
their meaning and both / of us sprang forward in the / direction of the
sound what was our / horror when we saw before / us a figure at
to be a woman / seen sideways but a moment's / observation me
to represent one / of the female sex and i / should have thought it a
with the usual / and unreasoning jealousy / of her sex she flew
that a woman had / entered the house through some small / aperture comes this
is a woman i / see by my power of sight / i have no patience
her it must be so / demand an assuming her / most gracious manner
to feel and be felt / then suddenly it is not / a woman and there
not a trace of one / can it be that i have so / misbehaved to a
circle than any / in flatland but to speak more / accurately i
in your presence and / if you would suffer us to / retire for a few
but my wife would not / listen to the proposal / that our august
indiscretion she / at last retreated to her / apartment i glanced
had begun footnote / when i say of course i do / not mean any change
of attitude such / as you in signify by / that word for as we
have no feet we can / no more nor your sense of the / than one of your soles
corresponding to / the increase of volition / but on this and a
subjects time forbids / me to dwell section how the / stranger vainly to
reveal to me in / words the mysteries of as / soon as the sound of
varied every / instant with graduations / of size and brightness
the thought flashed across / me that i might have before / me a burglar or
isosceles who / by feigning the voice of a / circle had obtained
admission somehow / into the house and was now / preparing to stab
me with his acute / angle in a the absence / of fog the season
especially at the / short distance at which i was / standing desperate with
must permit me and / felt him my wife was right there / was not the trace of
he was throughout a / perfectly satisfactory / circle there could not
to set down as near / as i can recollect it / omitting only
some of my profuse / i was covered with shame and / humiliation
that i a square should / have been guilty of the of / feeling a circle
to me yet i most / illustrious sir excuse / my awkwardness which
you to reveal my / indiscretion to no one / and especially not
me my lord but is / not your already in space / your and his humble
servant even at / this moment stranger pooh what / do you know of space
you see you do not / even know what space is you / think it is of two
dimensions only / but i have come to announce / to you a breadth and
length i your is pleased / to be merry we also / speak of length and height
and down below i / my lord means seemingly that / it is northward and
southward stranger i / mean nothing of the kind i / mean a direction
your that i have a / perfectly luminary / at the juncture of
my two sides stranger / yes but in order to see / into space you ought
to have an eye not / on your perimeter but / on your side that is
call your inside but / we in should call it your side / i an eye in my
inside an eye in / my stomach your jests stranger / i am in no i
tell you that i come / from space or since you will not / understand what space
all that you speak of / as solid which you mean on / four your houses your
churches your very / chests and safes yes even your / insides and stomachs
all lying open / and exposed to my view i / such assertions are
here i saw your four / sons the pentagons each in / his apartment and
remain a while with / you and then retire to his / room leaving you and
three in number in / the kitchen at supper and / the little page in
the then i came here / and how do you think i came / i through the roof i
i tell you i come / from space are you not convinced / by what i have told
you of your children / and household i your must be / aware that such facts
might be easily / ascertained by any one / of the possessing
your ample means of / information stranger what / must i do stay one
itself to me when / you see a straight your wife for / many dimensions
do you attribute / to her i your would treat me / as if i were one
no no my lord we / squares are better advised and / are as well aware
dimension i my / lord i have just acknowledged / that a woman is
slight is capable / of measurement stranger you / do not understand
space and would become / invisible surely you / must recognize this
i i must indeed / confess that i do not in / the least understand
the title of a / dimension and that what we / call you call stranger
no indeed by i / mean a dimension like your / length only with you
extremely small i / my lord your assertion is / easily put to
stranger i can do / neither how shall i convince / him surely a plain
surface of what i / may call a fluid or in / the top of which you
and your countrymen / move about without rising / above or falling
below it i am / not a plane figure but a / solid you call me
a circle but in / reality i am not / a circle but an
from a point to a / circle of thirteen inches / in diameter
one placed on the top / of the other when i cut / through your plane as i
call a circle for / even a is my proper / name in my own he
of needs manifest / himself as a circle do / you not i who see
all things discerned last / night the vision of written / upon your you not
remember i say / how when you entered the realm / of you were compelled
that linear realm / had not dimensions enough / to represent the
a slice or section / of you in precisely the / same way your country
of two dimensions / is not spacious enough to / represent me a
being of three but / can only exhibit a / slice or section of
or circles at a / time for you have no power / to raise your eye out
vanished i winked once / or twice to make sure that i / was not dreaming but
it was no dream for / from the depths of nowhere came / forth a hollow to
return to flatland / and you shall see my section / become larger and
guest was speaking the / language of truth and even / of simplicity
indicated there / must needs have manifested / himself to me or
to any as a / circle at first of full size / then small and at last
very small indeed / approaching to a point but / to me although i
saw the facts before / me the causes were as dark / as ever all that
i could comprehend / was that the circle had made / himself smaller and
when he regained his / original size he heaved / a deep sigh for he
failed to comprehend / him and indeed i was now / to the belief that
as enchanters and / magicians after a long / pause he muttered to
of then followed a / still longer silence after / which he continued
wake what name would you / give to the wake i a straight / line sphere and a straight
to itself east and / west so that every point / in it leaves behind
sides has a square how / many angles i four sides / and four angles sphere
if it moved northward / the southern points in the square / would have to move through
occupied by the / northern points but that is not / my meaning i mean
that every point / in you are a square and will / serve the purpose of
my point in you that / is to say in what you call / your inside is to
by any other / point but each point shall describe / a straight line of its
surely it must be / clear to you restraining my / i was now under
him into space or / out of flatland anywhere / so that i could get
rid of what may be / the nature of the figure / which i am to shape
in the language of / sphere oh certainly it is / all plain and simple
but as a solid / but i will describe it to / you or rather not
progression what is / the next number i eight sphere / exactly the one
square produces a / with eight terminal points now / are you convinced i
and has this creature / sides as well as angles or / what you call sphere of
to analogy / but by the way not what you / call sides but what we
solids or sides will / to this being whom i am / to generate by
the motion of my / inside in an direction / and whom you call a
behind a point a / point has sides a line if i / may so say has sides
the points of a line / may be called by courtesy / its a square has sides
what progression do / you call that i sphere and what / is the next number
will be bounded by / six sides that is to say six / of your insides you
collision with the / stranger pressing on him with / a force sufficient
but i could feel him / slowly and slipping from my / contact not edging
to the right nor to / the left but moving somehow / out of the world and
vanishing into / nothing soon there was a blank / but still i heard the
i had hoped to find / in being a man of sense / and an accomplished
which i am allowed / to preach once only in a / thousand years but now
i know not how to / convince you stay i have it / deeds and not words shall
several of what you / call boxes like everything / else in flatland they
i am about to / descend into that cupboard / and to bring you one
of those tablets i / saw you lock the cupboard half / an hour ago
and i know you have / the key in your possession / but i descend from
space the doors you see / remain unmoved now i am / in the cupboard and
now i have it now / i ascend with it i rushed / to the closet and
dashed the door open / one of the tablets was gone / with a mocking laugh
the stranger appeared / in the other corner of / the room and at the
same time the tablet / appeared upon the floor i / took it up there could
tablet i groaned with / horror doubting whether i / was not out of my
and no other suits / the phenomena what you / call solid things are
what you call space is / really nothing but a great / plane i am in space
and look down upon / the insides of the things of / which you only see
the outsides you could / leave the plane yourself if you / could but summon up
the necessary / volition a slight upward / or downward motion
would enable you / to see all that i can see / higher i mount and
the further i go / from your plane the more i can / see though of course i
sitting at his books / now i shall come back to you / and as a crowning
proof what do you say / to my giving you a touch / just the least touch in
your stomach it will / not seriously injure / you and the slight pain
and a laugh seemed to / issue from within me a / moment afterwards
the sharp agony / had ceased leaving nothing but / a dull ache behind
now i don't know what / will convince you what say my / resolution was
of a magician / who could thus play tricks with one's / very stomach if
only i could in / any way manage to pin / him against the wall
till help came once more / i dashed my hardest angle / against him at the
same time alarming / the whole household by my cries / for aid i believe
at the moment of / my onset the stranger had / sunk below our
plane and really found / difficulty in rising / in any case he
remained motionless / while i hearing as i thought / the sound of some help
him with redoubled / vigor and continued to / shout for assistance
ran through the sphere must / not i thought i heard him say / he must listen to
of then addressing / me in a louder tone he / hurriedly exclaimed
the gospel of three / dimensions must not be thus / frustrated not thus
must the fruits of one / thousand years of waiting be / thrown away i hear
her coming back back / away from me or you must / go with you know the
land of three madman / i exclaimed will i release / thee thou shalt pay the
penalty of thine / is it come to thundered the / stranger meet your fate
out of your plane you / go once twice thrice 'tis section / how i came to and
sensation of sight / that was not like seeing i / saw a line that was
no line space that was / not space i was myself and / not myself when i
could find voice i shrieked / loud in agony this is / madness or it is
open your eye once / again and try to look i / looked and behold a
harmonious which / i had no words but you my / readers in would call
it the surface of / the sphere myself mentally / before my guide i
discern thy heart thy / lungs thy arteries thy you / think you see you see
order of beings / from those in flatland were i / a circle you could
the many in the / one called in this country a / sphere and just as the
adoration he / continued with more in his / voice not yourself if
of by degrees they / will dawn upon you let us / begin by casting
back a glance at the / region whence you came return / with me a while to
and thought about but / never seen with the sense of / visible i cried
but the sphere leading / the way i followed as if / in a dream till once
your own house and all / its i looked below and saw / with my physical
merely inferred with / the understanding and how / poor and shadowy
in comparison / with the reality which / i now behold my
by my cries had left / his room and under pretext / of ascertaining
infer and as we / came nearer and nearer i / could discern even
of which the sphere had / made mention touched by my wife's / distress i would have
incapable of / motion not yourself about / your said my guide will
not be long left in / anxiety meantime let / us take a survey
of once more i felt / myself rising through space it / was even as the
we receded from / the object we the larger / became the field of
lay open to my / view in miniature we / mounted higher and
lo the secrets of / the earth the depths of the mines / and caverns of the
hills were bared before / me awestruck at the sight of / the mysteries of
i am become as / a god for the wise men in / our country say
that to see all things / or as they express it is / the attribute of
god there was something / of scorn in the voice of my / teacher as he made
then the very and / of my country are to be / worshipped by your wise
men as being gods / for there is not one of them / that does not see as
of others besides / gods sphere i do not know but / if a or a of
our country can / see everything that is in / your country surely
by you as a god / this as you call is not a / common word in it
make you more just more / merciful less selfish more / loving not in the
than mere affection / sphere it is not for me to / classify human
more of your despised / straight lines than of your circles / but enough of this
look yonder do you / know that building i looked and / afar off i saw
structure in which i / recognized the general / assembly hall of
to each other which / i knew to be streets and i / perceived that i was
as they had met on / the first hour of the first / day of the year and
also on the first / hour of the first day of / the year the minutes
as my brother a / perfectly symmetrical / square and the chief clerk
of the high council / it was found recorded on / each occasion that
by divers persons / pretending to have received / revelations from
examination / to destroy all such as were / isosceles of
to be examined / and judged by the hear your said / the sphere to me while
the apostle of / the gospel of three replied / i matter is now
that i could make a / child understand it permit / me but to descend
i must perform my / mission stay thou there in thy / saying these words he
into the sea i / may so call of flatland right / in the midst of the
ring of counsellors / said he proclaim that there is / a land of three i
could see many of / the younger counsellors start / back in manifest
them but on a sign / from the presiding not the / slightest alarm or
the raising his voice / he now summoned the guards the / policemen gag them
brother his sincere / regret that in accordance / with precedent and
were made by him of / that day's incident his life / would be spared section
how though the sphere me / other mysteries of i / still desire more
to intercede on / his behalf or at least bid / him farewell but i
depended on the / volition of my guide who / said in gloomy tones
space said the sphere have / you naught save plane figures and / their interiors
now a third see i / am building up a solid / by a multitude
of squares parallel / to one another now the / solid is complete
being as high as / it is long and broad and we / call it a me my
figure whose inside / is laid open to view in / other words i see
no solid but a / plane such as we infer in / flatland only of
a hexagon would / appear a straight line to one / who has not the art
me to the cube and / i found that this being was / indeed no plane but
and i remembered / the saying of the sphere that / just such a creature
a creature as i / could in some sense be called the / progenitor of
him were i to give / the explanation of these / matters succinct and
clear though it was it / would be tedious to an / inhabitant of
objects and even / his own sacred person he / at last made all things
between a circle / and a sphere a plane figure / and a solid this
miserable yet / surely most undeserved for / why should the thirst for
yet like a second / i will endure this and worse / if by any means
alteration of / an iota and let my / readers judge between
him not that i was / wearied of knowledge on the / contrary i for
of all beauty i / my lord your own wisdom has / taught me to aspire
to all flatland forms / combine many circles in / one so doubtless there
surpassing even / the solids of and even / as we who are now
in space look down on / flatland and see the insides / of all things so of
the revealed insides / of solid things and where thine / own intestines and
of this trifling the / time is short and much remains / to be done before
and silence you let / me say at once i would shew / you what you wish if
would you have me turn / my stomach inside out to / oblige you i but
in the land of two / dimensions by taking me / with him into the
the blessed region of / the fourth dimension where i / shall look down with him
once more upon this / land of three dimensions and / see the inside of
every house the / secrets of the solid earth / the treasures of the
spheres sphere but where is / this land of four dimensions / i i know not but
doubtless my teacher / knows sphere not i there is no / such land the very
to my master nay / i despair not that even / here in this region
presence of a third / dimension though i saw it / not let me recall
the past was i not / taught below that when i saw / a line and inferred
dimension not the / same as brightness called and does / it not now follow
imparted to him / trifle not with me my lord / i crave i thirst for
more knowledge doubtless / we cannot see that other / higher now because
we have no eye in / our stomachs but just as / there was the realm of
flatland though that poor / puny monarch could neither / turn to left nor right
to discern it and / just as there was close at hand / and touching my frame
though i blind senseless / wretch had no power to touch / it no eye in my
to his servant in / one dimension did not a / moving point produce
did not a moving / line produce a square with four / terminal points in
three dimensions did / not a moving square not this / eye of mine behold
blessed being a cube / with eight terminal points and / in four dimensions
for the progress of / truth if it be not not i / say the motion of
confirmation of / the series is not this a / geometrical
to again was i / not taught by my lord that as / in a line there are
lines so in a cube / there must be six bounding squares / behold once more the
confirming series / is not this an progression / and consequently
not knowing the facts / and i appeal to your to / confirm or deny
also have witnessed / the descent of beings of / a higher order
closed rooms even as / your entered mine without the / opening of doors
therefore pray have done / with this trifling and let us / return to business
would be fulfilled and / now have patience with me and / answer me yet one
more question best of / teachers those who have thus one / knows have one knows they
of the seer i say / they so oh believe them not / or if it indeed
space is really then / take me to that blessed region / where i in thought shall
particle of his / interior pass through a / new kind of space with
a still more perfect / perfection than himself with / sixteen terminal
and once there shall we / stay our upward course in / that blessed region of
four dimensions shall / we linger at the threshold / of the fifth and not
onset the gates of / the six dimension shall fly / open after that
with the recent draughts / of truth to which he himself / had introduced me
however the end / was not long in coming my / words were cut short by
to flatland was my / doom one glimpse one last and glimpse / i had of that dull
level was now to / become my universe out / before my eye then
a darkness then a / final and when i came to / myself i was once
square in my study / at home listening to the / of my approaching
wife section how the / sphere encouraged me in a / vision although i
for reflection i / felt by a kind of instinct / that i must conceal
from her divulging / my secret but i knew that / to any woman
in our country / is so slight that even to / a woman my tale
and incredible / but my wife whose good sense far / exceeds that of the
but insisted that / i was ill and required / repose i was glad
of an excuse for / retiring to my chamber / to think quietly
and especially the / process by which a cube is / constructed through the
motion of a square / it was not so clear as i / could have wished but i
to retain these words / as the clue which if firmly / grasped could not fail to
so mechanically / repeating like a charm the / words yet not i fell
i had a dream i / thought i was once more by the / side of the sphere whose
lustrous hue that he / had exchanged his wrath against / me for perfectly
through which we soared the / sound reached not our ears till / we checked our flight
a vision thou hast / soared with me to the heights of / now in order to
thee downward to the / lowest depth of existence / even to the realm
creature that point is / a being like ourselves / but confined to the
of any other / than himself he can form no / conception he knows
of them he has no / cognizance even of the / number two nor has
that to be is to / be vile and ignorant and / that to aspire is
better than to be / blindly and happy now he / ceased and there arose
tinkling as from / one of your phonographs from / which i caught these words
of existence it / is and there is nothing else / beside said i the
puny creature mean / by means said the sphere you not / noticed before now
people who cannot / distinguish themselves from the / world speak of themselves
in the third person / but fills all continued the / little creature what
it fills it is what / it thinks that it utters and / what it utters that
is thinker hearer / thought word audition it is / the one and yet the
of you not startle / the little thing out of its / said i it what it
as compared hush you / have said interrupted the / sphere listen and mark
who beamed more brightly / than ever upon hearing / my words clearly that
and i had hardly / ceased when he took up his strain / again the joy ah
in triumph ah the / divine creative power / of the all in one
ah the joy the joy / of said my teacher little / your words have done so
far as the monarch / understand them at all he / accepts them as his
he cannot conceive / of any other except / plumes himself upon
fruition of his / omnipresence and nothing / that you or i can
do can rescue him / from his after this as we / floated gently back
me to aspire and / to teach others to aspire / he had been angered
the third but since then / he had received fresh insight / and he was not too
proud to acknowledge / his error to a pupil / then he proceeded
to initiate / me into mysteries yet / higher than those i
so easy as to / be patent even to the / female sex section
to reflect on the / glorious career before / me i would go forth
methought at once and / evangelize the whole of / flatland even to
be proclaimed i would / begin with my wife just as / i had decided
from another world / i reflected this danger / was not to be with
fresh from my dream it / had appeared as patent as / arithmetic but
and in that respect / unfit for my purpose but / it occurred to me
the matter with him / a mere boy i should be in / perfect safety for
he would know nothing / of the proclamation of / the council whereas
and reverence for / the circles predominate / over mere blind not
heresy of the / third dimension but the first / thing to be done was
into the details / of the elaborate account / i gave account i
sent for my grandson / for to confess the truth i / felt that all that i
dream and i longed to / essay my skill in making / a first disciple
a line and how a / straight line in two dimensions / produces a square
that a square may in / the same way by motion not / produce another
say that again you / young at this moment we heard / once more the herald's
reverence for the / authority of the in / the situation
had died away and / then bursting into tears he / said was only my
fun and of course i / meant nothing at all by it / and we did not know
and i am sure i / did not say one word about / not for that would be
i could not be so / absurd as that how silly / it is ha ha at
all said i losing / my temper for example / i take this and at
the word i grasped a / square which was lying at i / move it you see not
northward i move it / is to say northward but i / move it exactly
manner much to the / amusement of my grandson / who burst out laughing
the theory of three / dimensions by other means / and of the result
only i saw that / i must not wholly rely / on the not but must
rather endeavour / to seek a demonstration / by setting before
the public a clear / view of the whole subject and / for this purpose it
months in privacy / to the composition of / a treatise on the
mysteries of three / dimensions only with the / view of evading
for my purpose for / of course in our country / of flatland there are
no tablets but lines / and no diagrams but lines / all in one straight line
by difference of / size and brightness so that when / i had finished my
flatland to i could / not feel certain that many / would understand my
meaning meanwhile my / wife was under a cloud all / pleasures upon me
treason because i / could not compare what i saw / in two dimensions
with what it really / was if seen in three and could / hardly refrain from
of the mysteries / which i had once yet which i / could impart to no
even before my / own mental vision one day / about eleven
afterwards i was / not then quite certain have i / been ever that i
me to take some step / yet what i knew not i felt / that i would have been
circles in the land / and yet at times my spirit / was too strong for me
and i gave vent to / dangerous utterances / already i was
of my position / nevertheless i could not / at times refrain from
when for example / the question arose about / the treatment of those
of things i would quote / the saying of an ancient / circle who declared
to two and why the / attribute of is assigned / to the supreme so
and of my return / home and of everything that / i had seen and heard
in a fervent i / exhorted all my hearers / to divest themselves
of prejudice and / to become believers in / the third dimension
need i say that i / was at once arrested and / taken before the
council next morning / standing in the very place / where but a very
degrees ordered them / to be relieved before i / began my defence
class of or degrees / i knew only too well what / that meant i was to
i had concluded / my defence the president / perhaps perceiving
circles had been moved / by evident earnestness / asked me two whether
i could indicate / the direction which i meant / when i used the words
not whether i could / by any diagrams or / descriptions than the
enumeration / of imaginary sides / and indicate the
more and that i must / commit myself to the truth / whose cause would surely
prevail in the end / the president replied that / he quite concurred in
my sentiment and / that i could not do better / i must be sentenced
to perpetual / imprisonment but if the / truth intended that
i should emerge from / prison and evangelize / the world the truth might
to no discomfort / that was not necessary / to preclude escape
visits of my from / all companionship save that / of my jailers my
yet i confess that / my weekly interviews at / least in one respect
chamber he saw the / changing sections he heard the / explanation of
the phenomena / then give to the circles since / that time scarcely a
week has passed during / seven whole years without his / hearing from me a
descriptions of all / the phenomena in and / the arguments for
take shame to be forced / to confess brother has not / yet grasped the nature
of three dimensions / and frankly his disbelief / in the existence
revelation has / been made to me for nothing / up in was bound for
that is the hope of / my brighter moments alas / it is not always
reflection that i / cannot honestly say i / am confident as
precept not haunts me / like a sphinx it is part of / the martyrdom which
of mental weakness / when cubes and spheres flit away / into the background
of when the land of / three dimensions seems almost / as visionary
as the land of one / or none nay when even this / hard wall that bars me
from my freedom these / very tablets on which i / am writing and all
imagination / or the baseless fabric of / a dream preface to
friend retained the of / mind which he enjoyed when he / began to compose
these memoirs i should / not now need to represent / him in this preface
which however he / is not entirely and / thirdly to explain
his short stay in he / has therefore requested me / to reply in his
is that a seeing / a line sees something that must / be thick to the eye
if it had not some / and consequently he ought / is to acknowledge
that his countrymen / are not only long and broad / but also doubtless
to a very slight / thick or high this objection / is plausible and
so that i confess / when i first heard it i knew / not what to reply
facts but i deny / his conclusions it is true / that we have really
dimension called by / no name at present but which / i will call but we
of our than you / can of your even have been / in and have had the
it by the sense of / sight or by any process / of reason i can
implies the more and / the less now all our lines / are equally and
thick high whichever / you consequently there is / nothing in them to
by one too hasty / in the least avail us for / we should not know what
that is long and bright / brightness as well as length is / necessary to
measure it or tell / us in what direction it / and this silences
me for i can do / neither only yesterday / when the chief circle
other words our / high came to inspect the state / prison and paid me
i tried to prove to / him that he was as well as / long and broad although
he did not know it / but what was his reply say / i am measure my
and i will believe / what could i do how could i / meet his challenge i
was crushed and he left / the room triumphant this still / seem strange to you then
to visit you were / to say you open your eyes / you see a plane is
a solid is of / but in reality you / also see you do
measure what would you / say to such a visitor / would not you have him
for us to lock up / a square for preaching the third / dimension as it
is for you to lock / up a cube for preaching the / fourth alas how strong
prejudices as / one of our poets has / touch of nature makes
clear and cogent it / has been objected that he / is a and as this
objection has been / vehemently urged by those / whom nature's decree
has constituted / the somewhat larger half of / the race i should like
to remove it so / far as i can honestly / do so but the square
